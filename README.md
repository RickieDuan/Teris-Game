# Teris-Game

A game of Biquadris(Teris) consists of two boards, each 11 columns wide and 15 rows high. Blocks consisting of four cells
(tetrominoes) appear at the top of each board, and you must drop them onto their respective boards so as not to leave any gaps.
Once an entire row has been filled, it disappears, and the blocks above move down by one unit.

Biquadris differs from Tetris in one significant way: it is not real-time. You have as much time as you want to decide
where to place a block. Players will take turns dropping blocks, one at a time. A player’s turn ends when he/she has dropped
a block onto the board (unless this triggers a special action; see below). During a player’s turn, the block that the opponent
will have to play next is already at the top of the opponent’s board (and if it doesn’t fit, the opponent has lost).
